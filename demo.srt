00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:35,000
This is my unsupervised video anomaly detection system.

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Trained only on normal data — no anomaly labels needed.

3
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:20,000
High reconstruction error = anomaly detected.

4
00:01:20,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Grad-CAM and LIME explain where the anomaly is.

5
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Spikes in this graph show unusual events like cars in pedestrian zones.

6
00:02:45,000 --> 00:03:00,000
